# A=1: Expressions: *,-,/,+
#      Values: 'hello',-87.8,6

# A=2: String is a data type.
#      Variable stores the data type such as strings. a memory gets allocated in the ram which defined by the variable when a      variable is called it invokes the data stored in the variable by going to the memory

# A=3: Int: it indicates the data type is an integer e.g. 2 , 5 , etc
#      float: it indiactes the data type has decimal values
#      str: it indicates the data type has alphabets e.g "Abhi" enclosed by single or double inverted commas

# A=4: Expression is basically used to perform various operations such as concatation, subtraction, additon, on similar data types
#     it consists of operators like +,-,/*

# A=5: spam = 10 is a statement as it indicates that in python a variable is created called spam which has an integer data type value 10 . so whenever spam will be called in the programme due to the statement spam = 10 we will get the output of 10. it executes the statement
# whereas expression can perform operations and can even change the value of spam using operators like +,- for e.g. below code
# 

# In[1]:


spam=10
spam


# In[3]:


spam=10+10
spam


# as we can see in above code statement does not change the value it is only used to execute the program whereas the expression + changed the value
# 

# A=6: 23

# A=7:spamspamspam
#     spamspamspam
# 

# In[7]:


'spam'*3


# A=8: 100 is not a valid variable name because 100 is an integer value which corresponds to int data type when you declare the 100 a variable system will not create a space in memory to store values as it will interpret is as data type only
# however eggs is a valid variable since it begins with an alphabet and is not a standard pre defined data type in programming languae
# 

# A=9: int() , float() , and str( )
# 
# for e.g let's try to get the int,float and str value of 235.343435
# 

# In[8]:


int(235.343435)


# In[9]:


float(235.343435)


# In[10]:


str(235.343435)


# A=10: I have eaten &#39; + 99 + &#39; burritos.&#39;
# 
# concotation is only done for homogenous data type. we can fix the error by enclosing the integer 99 in single/double inverted commas
